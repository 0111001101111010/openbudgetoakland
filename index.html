<p>One example of what's to come. We'll soon launch with several new visualizations as well as a conversation platform. We'll also host a library of data sets and open-source tools for you to create your own visuals -- and post them on Open Budget. Stay tuned. <small>Disclaimer: Visualization above for demo purposes only; data to be verified. Built with <a href="http://openspending.org" target="_blank">OpenSpending</a>.</small></p>
<h2>Help build this!</h2>

<p>Developers and data geeks needed. We <a href="http://www.meetup.com/cfabrigade/Open-Oakland/">meet</a> Tuesdays 6â€“9:30pm at City Hall as part of <a href="http://openoakland.org/">OpenOakland</a> hack night. </p>

<p><em><strong>Open Budget Oakland</strong> promotes a deeper understanding of the city budget, enabling citizens, officials, and other stakeholders to engage in more informed dialogue about how the City of Oakland currently works and how it should in the future. We turn raw data into interactive visualizations, share tools for people to create their own, and provide a forum for collective dialogue about the details and the (various) big pictures.</em></p>
